        <h1>Hobbies</h1>
        <p>
            One of my hobbies is that I love to play video games. When I was young I got injured pretty badly in a motocross accident, and my athletic career took a big pause. Video games were something to keep my ADHD at bay.
            I play mostly PC now but I still enjoy old consoles like N64 and sega. (yes I am old)

            A second hobby that I have is travelling. I try to get out and experience different cultures as much as I can. Right before covid I was in South America, mainly Brazil.
            This past summer I went to Europe and saw England and Portugal. I want to continue to travel and get as many stamps in my passport as I can!

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am definitely one to talk a lot, so telling you about myself shouldn't be too hard. My name is Mike Egan and I am 27 years old. I was born in Ottawa, Canada and I was actually adopted at an early age. Something that stands out about myself is that I really hold core values close to me. When I say that I'm saying that I value honesty, family, and certain things that I feel are over looked these days.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some interests I have are definitely computers, and defnitely sports. Sometimes people don't think those two things go together but I completely disagree. The thing I love most about sports are the analytics. I love how Amazon Web Services tracks some of the tinniest details. You can see to the exact decemal place of how fast someone is running. The sport I love the most is the NFL. Go Bills baby!
